# Based on the default Preonic layout

k4b doesn't work so can't use k4[89ab] as arrows

keyboard has no backlight so that is gone and k40 is now an arrow layer for the right hand [jkil]

I love having both del and backspace!

next: mouse..

Mouse done, I feel the need for a quicker access to backspace because I'm typoing a lot

I press enter a lot when trying to right shift, going to force myself to use layers by moving both to enter and backspace to raise/lower spacebar and add the right shift again

Adding my favourite intellij shortcut as a single key (for fun!)

Not bad except for qwerty hating the home row and the arrow key being hard to combine with modifiers

Moving the arrow layer to the right thumb and practicing dvorak...

Disabling the top row to simulate a Planck

Not really using the mouse button at all and struggling with the arrows. On a positive note k4b is back in action!
