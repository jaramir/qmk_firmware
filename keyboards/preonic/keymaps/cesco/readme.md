# Based on the default Preonic layout

k4b doesn't work so can't use k4[89ab] as arrows

keyboard has no backlight so that is gone and k40 is now an arrow layer for the right hand [jkil]

I love having both del and backspace!

next: mouse..

Mouse done, I feel the need for a quicker access to backspace because I'm typoing a lot
